Yesterday I gave a speech on [talk.js](https://www.facebook.com/groups/talkjs.net) meet up. My presentation's title was JavaScript for the rest of us. It was on [vue.js](http://vuejs.org) actually. The title is little weird as the context is different. My motivation was, I am going to introduce vue.js to those group, whose are actually backend developers, write mostly server rendered application, use a very least amount of javascript for improving user interaction. This group mostly used jQuery for their JS need. My goal is to introduce themselves with a wonderful framework, which has a very little footprint and a very elegant syntax to improve their js code.

As my talks' title was little weird, [Mafinar Bhai](https://www.facebook.com/mafinar) trolled me a lot, and he promised he will continue this for the next three or four months. I will try to enjoy those. ðŸ™‚
