Recently I was in a debate with 3 other very great software professional at Basis Software Expo, 2017 about Laravel vs Django. I know, comparing between these two is like comparison between orange and apple. Actually, our main target was to present the feature set that these two frameworks offer but in a form of debate so that, people especially the newcomers get a good grasp on these frameworks. We had a very limited time to debate, so we could not focus on all the parts. So, I think why not write a blog post about the topic and thus comes this blog post.

Laravel is a very popular web framework, it is the most popular php framework and probably the most popular web framework of any language as well. Though it is comparatively very new, but it has some awesome features. So, here is the features that you should know about laravel-

- Laravel has a great community. It is huge and very friendly.
- It has arguably the best learning site on the Interner, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com). [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) is a great teacher.
- Laravel provides a whole eco-system. It ensures developer's happiness from development to deployment.

  - Development: Valet, Homedtead
  - Built in Testing: both unit and browser testing
  - Code Review: NitpickCI
  - Asset Management: Elixir, Laravel Mix
  - Great Task runner: Laravel Envoy
  - Server Provisioning: Forge
  - Zero Downtime Deployment: Enroyer
  - Monitoring Tool: Cachet

- Great ORM, built-in Queue System, Out of the box Redis support.

- Scaffolding Tools: Spark, Backpack

- Stable Release Cycle and LTS support. A new version of laravel comes every 6 months and a long-term support version comes in every 2 years.

- Great features, like- realtime broadcasting (Echo), Multiple notification channels, Task schedular, Multiple drivers for most of the components(session, cache, queue, mail, events etc.)

- Laravel has some great first party packages

  - Payment Gateway: Cashier
  - OAuth2 Server: Passport
  - Social Authentication: Socialite(support more than 80 sites)
  - Full-text search: Scout

- Laravel is very beginner friendly with very little entry barrier.

- Migration, Template Engine with markdown support.

- Great Command Line Utility: Artisan.

- Tons of community driven packages.

To be honest, Laravel is the best thing that happens to me in last 2-3 years. It prevented me from leaving php. I also wrote a bestseller [book](https://milon.im/laravel) on Laravel in Bengali. If you are interested, you can also look into it.
